# Ohana CAH Online Game

## Pretend you're Xyzzy 

This is the name of the site. Works best on a computer, but usable on mobile. There is an [android app](#android-app) if you want to use that. Instructions for that are at the end. 


Here is the link to the game I have setup. 
https://pyx-4.pretendyoure.xyz/zy/game.jsp#game=XXX

When you get to the site, create any NickName. Optional ID code is optional.

Enter the password.

You can also find the game by searching for my NickName "kilted_nerd".

## Android app

[Client for Pretend You're Xyzzy (open source)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gianlu.pretendyourexyzzy&hl=en_US)

This is the android app that I have tested and it works fine, but you might need to **add** the server. 

Start the app (It has a tutorial, so go through that).

When you see it, select "Change Server". Then click "Manage". 

Then the "+" at the top, The name is "**A windmill full of corpses**", the server URL is `"https://pyx-4.pretendyoure.xyz/zy"`. 

Click "Change Server" again, select the new server, then create a Nickname. Optional id code is optional.

Once you're in search for "kilted_nerd", which is my NickName in the game. Enter password. Drink and play.

## IOS/Apple

No app. Sorry. Browser only.
